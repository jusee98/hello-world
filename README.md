hello! 
this is a homework project so im just gonna talk about music im interested in.
my favorite band is muse.
it consists of three talented englishmen.
their first album, showbiz, was released in 1999 and gives an overall idea of where they were planning to head with their music 
but real first success was accomplished with 2001 follow up album origin of symmetry.
building up on that success, album number three sparked about the same reaction among fans and critics.
their 2006 album features popular singles such as starlight as well as the iconic album closer knights of cydonia.
after that, muse released four additional albums, all widely ranging in style and experimenting with new sounds and genres. 
their latest release, titled simulation theory, was followed by a highly successful and visually impressive world tour that featured dancers, smoke, a whole lot of led jackets and a giant inflatable robot skeleton named murph.
